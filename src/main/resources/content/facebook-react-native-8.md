I want to implement support for Webpack dev server.

This is essential to my workflow as I rely on transforms such as 6to5. I also want to integrate Hot Module Replacement to React Native so that updates without losing component state or unmounting are possible.

Where should I start looking?

Host your files on localhost and you're done. Search through the code for localhost to see the specific paths you need to get working.

Gotcha! I'll try that.

Closing this for now as we're probably not going to support webpack-dev-server, but I really want to get hot loader working. Please re-open if you need help on react hot loader :)

Sure, once I'm more comfortable with the setup I'll take another look!
