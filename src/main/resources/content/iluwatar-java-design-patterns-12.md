hello iluwatar

when I read the Singleton  pattern ,the ThreadSafeLazyLoadedIvoryTower class use the default constructor method ,you don't specify it ï¼Œshould it right ?
I think must add a private constructor as the IvoryTower class.
is it right?

Yes wokaole, that is right. Private constructor should be added. Thanks for pointing it out.
