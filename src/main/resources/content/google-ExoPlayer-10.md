Most of the time when mobile have low internet bandwidth the player download and buffering all video file, but the player don't play and photo still freeze.
So if you want to rerun the video you must click previous button until the start of video.
this happen in both SimplePlayerActivity and FullPlayerActivity.

If this is only happening on a custom ROM then you should file a bug against the custom ROM in the first instance. Does it happen on any official Samsung builds?

I use official Samsung builds not custom ROM.

I experience this problem on a stock Nexus 7, 2013 version. Running latest KitCat.

Does this occur with the streams included in the demo app, or some that you've added yourself? Which videos specifically? There's not really enough to go on here.

Specific reproduction steps and/or full bug reports would be a great help. Thanks!

Not enough information to reproduce, so closing for now. This may well have been fixed on the dev branch as part of the fix for #21.
