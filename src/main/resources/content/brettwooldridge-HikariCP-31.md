Stumbled on this interesting tool today. Do you have guidance for expressing the appcontext config instead as a persistence.xml - following your MySQL example using JPA (2.x), Hibernate (4.x)?

How about this?

I'm not really a JPA guy, and the Spring+Hibernate configuration that is on the wiki was taken from another site.  If you create a working configuration and wish to share it, I'll be happy to put it into the wiki for other users.
