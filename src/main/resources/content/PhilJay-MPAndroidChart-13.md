It would be great to have legends for the charts.
Either next to the chart (below, top, left, right side) or within the chart area would help.

Work already in progress, thank you. ;-)

The legend feature is now available in a first version, enjoy.
By default, the legend is created automatically.

For further customization, you can call `Chart.getLegend()` and then customize it after setting data.
