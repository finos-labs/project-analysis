Please make it compatible with Android 4.0.4 :)


## theScrabi (17 Sept 2015)

That could be harsh. A lot of functions are used witch require api level 16 (Android 4.1).


## theScrabi (20 Sept 2015)

Ok minimum api level is 15 now. May cause some problems and Ui errors, but so far its working on 4.0.3.

Thanks a lot!
