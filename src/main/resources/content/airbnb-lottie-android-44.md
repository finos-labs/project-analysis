Would be nice to have this on the README so devs know it is supported on another framework for mobile development. Thanks. Was fun working with 👍

Awesome! Thanks for putting that together!

I'd have submitted a PR, but not sure where you all would prefer it on the README since it's not on Airbnb account like the initial header mention of the RN version.

## gpeal (02 Feb 2017)

I don't see the PR. I can put it on the Readme, it'll just be in a different section.

Yea sorry, that reads weird `I'd have submitted`. Meant I would have but didn't know where you would like it. Thanks for adding it though 😄
