#Horizontal multi-touch doesn't work with ViewPager

In the sample app, with the ViewPager an horizontal multi-touch gesture is very difficult to accomplish.
If the two fingers are vertical to each other, then it's easy. I suppose that the ViewPager is "stealing" any horizontal drags.

Perhaps a simple solution would be to disable the pager when two fingers are detected.

I would like to point out it does work, but yes is tricky, I'll see if I can alture the view pager to stop intercepting when two fingers are on the screen. I'll work on it in my fork.

I'm seeing this issue in my own application as well. The ImageView is in a FragmentPagerAdapter. two finger zooming on the vertical works fine but crashes with the following on the horizontal. http://pastebin.com/BDdVqNu9

@DazzyG: That is #4

@chrisbanes I thought #4 was fixed in fbe7598?

@DazzyG: What branch are you using? fbe7598ffdbdc40aa92590e079fcca7b9fdaf7d9 is in dev.


## DazzyG (08 Jan 2013)

@chrisbanes I'm using the dev branch.

I also caught an "pointerIndex out of range" when using dev branch.
Seems to happen only when you zoom out as much as possible.

I also have this problem with the dev branch and latest support library.

If I patch the support library like this in MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE, it works:

```
             if (pointerIndex == INVALID_POINTER) {
                 // If we don't have a valid id, the touch down wasn't on content.
                 break;
             }

             final float x = MotionEventCompat.getX(ev, pointerIndex);
```

Seems like it's using an id (1 instead of 0 in normal case) of the event that it can't handle. I have similar crashes in other libs too, so I suspect the issue is in the support library.

Yeah there is a bug in the support lib, I think fixes have been pushed but
no accepted, which is a shame as the r12 was meant to fix a lot of the
ViewPager issues.

I'm closing this issue, as I don't see any more complains from you guys. This issue is bound to Support v4 library, which is now r18 (6 new updates), I suppose this is fixed now, if not, reopen this issue or create new one. Thanks
