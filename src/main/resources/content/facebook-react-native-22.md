I'm due to do a introductory React talk this Wednesday evening - I expect I'll get a few questions about the React Native announcement.

I can point to the two keynote videos and talk broadly about the concepts behind it, and obviously I wont be handing out copies of the code - but am I allowed to show a little demo myself?

I don't mind either way, but wanted to make sure I'm not over-sharing.

The goal of this private repo is to give us some time to expose all the features that we have internally and get the feedback from people before opening the flood gates. Feel free to demo it and talk about what's inside
