Unless I missed something, the play pauses if the app main screen is left (but continues if the screen phone is locked). Background play would be much appreciated for listening to music I don't need to see!
Thanks looks good

Yeah, I can confirm that it plays while the screen is locked but it doesn't pause on any of my devices.

Hm right. For my own shame i need to say that the player was the last part I wrote, and I may have done it a bit sloppy. So yes the player will be reworked, and a "Listen to music" function will come to as son as i find time for it :)

Since this issue is pretty much the same one as this (https://github.com/theScrabi/NewPipe/issues/4) i'd like to merge the threads here.
