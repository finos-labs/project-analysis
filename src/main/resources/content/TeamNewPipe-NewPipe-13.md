Hi, thanks for this app, I like it! Additionally it would be nice to be able to cancel a download once it is started. Thanks a lot! Spectas

Well downloading is a bigger topic. I need to rework that completely. At the moment NP is using the build in DownloadManager. So a workaround would be to enter the DownloadManager while downloading, and then cancel the download there.

This is already covered by #285.
