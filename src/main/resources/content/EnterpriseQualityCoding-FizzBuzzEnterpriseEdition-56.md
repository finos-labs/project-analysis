In https://github.com/Mikkeren/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition/blob/65bbb7b88c0f8b27b326936ff296bf5b1a2a3568/src/main/java/com/seriouscompany/business/java/fizzbuzz/packagenamingpackage/impl/strategies/constants/NoFizzNoBuzzStrategyConstants.java there're two newlines in row - lines 2 and 3. How could this have happened in an enterprise grade Serious Project?
