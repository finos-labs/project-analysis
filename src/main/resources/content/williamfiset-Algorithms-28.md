I can do this one! But how do we handle dependencies on other algorithms? For example, this snippet depends on Floyd-Warshall.

## williamfiset (25 Oct 2017)

I always include all the dependencies someone needs inside the one file for the particular algorithm I'm developing even if it's a lot of duplication. I feel like this is the best solution so that all algorithms work out of the box.

I guess the only issue is if we find a bug or something in the
Floyd-Warshall snippet and then have to change it in a lot of spots.

We could make the whole project use packages/imports but then each snippet no longer works on its own. A hacky way to avoid this would be to somehow automatically copy the dependencies into the file by running a code auto generation tool. That does seems like a lot of work ATM though so I would hold off.

@micahstairs this is done, correct?

Correct!
