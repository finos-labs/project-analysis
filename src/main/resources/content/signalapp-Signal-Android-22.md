#TextSecure does not retry sending sms which fail to send.

IMHO failed sms should be added to a queue and sent later when there is enough signal strength to do send them.

I noticed the same thing, unfortunately it's a deal-breaker as soon as you are commonly moving through areas with bad reception.

I agree, a queue with a resend would be awesome.
And at least a notification if the sms sent has failed would be great. Those last days I've lost 6 sending of sms because of bad signal and I didn't know they didn't go well (even if there is a /!\ in the message list, but once sent, I don't double check, I prefer reading a book ^^')

Awesome, thanks Moxie0.

I will reinstall and have a play once it's rolled out.
