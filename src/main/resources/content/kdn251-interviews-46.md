UC Berkley decided to remove all of their online lecture videos ([link](http://news.berkeley.edu/2017/03/01/course-capture/)). Since the link for the UC Berkley Data Structures lecture is broken, should we consider removing it or possible replacing it? My suggestion would be to replace it with [this](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast). Which contains all of their removed videos on archive.org. Although I don't believe there is a specific playlist for CS lectures.

I can submit a PR if this seems like something worth adding.

Sorry for such a late response. If you could add that that'd be awesome!

No problem! I'll submit a PR.
