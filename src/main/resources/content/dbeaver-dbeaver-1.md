MySQL supports type "modifiers" and numeric "display width" meta-information.
Currently DBeaver doesn't support them.
Suggestion: redesign column editor. Existing one (type name and length are separate properties of column) isn't flexible enough.

Column editor now shows only full type name (including modifiers)
