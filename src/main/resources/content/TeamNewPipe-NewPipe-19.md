Doing a search for the word "lunopolis" gives 'network error'. The actual first item on youtube that Fennec web browser shows looks to be behind a paywall. ??

That might cause the problem. Although i never head to deal with paywalls in youtube yet. Might be that this is just not yet available in my country. Please provide a log, so  can get more information about whats actually happening.

I can confirm the bug.


## theScrabi (15 Sept 2015)

I can't. But if it's true that there are videos with paywall, it could possibly be that NP can't parse those properly and therefore break.
I really need a log to see whats going on. You may use alogcat in order to provide one:

I may also need a vpn connection into USA. I see what i can do.
