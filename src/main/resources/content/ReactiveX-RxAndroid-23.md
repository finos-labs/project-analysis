With multiple discussions forming around various things, I quickly wanted to gauge if people would prefer a mailing list? Personally I'm fine with using GH even for questions/discussions, not least because it makes it easy to cross reference code.

Alternatively we could establish an rxandroid mailing list on Google Groups?

I actually prefer github over mailing list.

I prefer github too.

github too.

Anyone interested in Slack? Slack's gone viral lately. ReactiveUI and ReactiveCocoa guys did create one for their own. I think it's quite worthy now.

there was a debate in the mobile team at SoundCloud whether we should adopt
Slack or not, but decided against it as the company uses IRC, and while I'm
personally not a fan of IRC, I found the idea to create yet another account
for yet another messaging tool a distracting idea.

so personally, I'm not really in favor of that, especially as they don't
see the need for real time interaction around this project (yet).
