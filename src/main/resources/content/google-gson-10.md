It should be possible to restrict Gson to only java.*, javax.* and
com.google.checkout.api.model.* and nothing else. 

This is probably a good security feature. We should look at Ant (or
eclipse) conventions for deciding how to define package mappings.

This seemed like a lot less useful feature than we originally thought so I am 
closing 
it.
