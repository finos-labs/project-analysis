After installing TextSecure from market, everything runs smooth and TextSecure works as intended. However after a reboot of the phone wifi works, but gsm/3g has no connection/error. There is a message "The process com.android.phone has stopped unexpectedly. Please try again".
After another reboot the problem insists. 
After removing TextSecure and rebooting, everything works as expected again.

Closing as this was a very old version of TS.  Please open if it's reproducible with the recent builds.
