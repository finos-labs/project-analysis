Using Samsung Galaxy SII, Android 4.1.2, Barcode Scanner V 4.6.0
Data from scanned QR for a vcard (previewed on screen) is not passed to contact. Contact App is being opened but no no new card is being created.
Can reproduce: Yes, Every single time, regardless of QR generator used.

What the Contacts app does after it answers is unrelated to the app. But I find the default is to show you a list of contacts to add to plus button to add new contact. Are you sure that is not what you are seeing?

My bad. It does not indeed open a prefiled contact. The + button is there. And does load the scanned data.
Thanks
