We need a logo for this project... Anyone wants to make a contribution?

## jmini (13 May 2018)

Here my proposition:
![icon_openapi-generator](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1222165/39965485-f5df0a1e-5699-11e8-8ae9-a0294f7a92dc.png)

Some source file icon with an OpenAPI logo.

Feel free to make other/better propositions...

I would suggest against embedding other logos. At lower resolution, this would be almost indistinguishable. For example, load my Intellij plug-in for Swagger Codegen (only one in the plug-in repository) and the .ignore plug-in as well. The file icon for .swagger-codegen-ignore is recognizable while small.

I like OPENAPI Initiative's call out to an interface with the double ended bar. I'm wondering if we could have a similar recognizable design while being unique.

I will try to find time over the next week too work up some designs as well.

Thoughts on something like this? I apologize ahead of time, it's been a while since I've designed a logo.

I wanted to incorporate something that calls out to the Open API logo with the colors and the interface bar, but also indicate tooling.

A variation by request… the above logo at an angle so it is square for avatar placement

The last one is the official logo. Thanks @jimschubert for the awesome design.

@jimschubert Great logo! Love how it ties to OpenAPI but has it's own message.

Is it possible to get this as a SVG?

Here is a SVG:
