#Pressing "DONE" in the AppintroActivity of Sample App does nothing

Ideally when the last page of App Intro has reached, on pressing "DONE" the IntroActivity should be closed by calling finish().

Same bug exists in the Google Play version of the sample.

Not a dealbreaker as such, but my OCD compelled me to open an issue for this. :p
