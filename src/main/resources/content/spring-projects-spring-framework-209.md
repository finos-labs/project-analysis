Currently, the [release virtual repository documentation](https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-framework/wiki/SpringSource-repository-FAQ#wiki-available_repositories) states that it aggregates milestone repositories:

> snapshot (aggregates libs-snapshot-local and libs-snapshot-s3-cache)
> milestone (aggregates libs-milestone-local and libs-milestone-s3-cache)
> release (aggregates libs-milestone-local and libs-milestone-s3-cache)

This should be corrected to state that it aggregates release repositories.
