I should stop updating to dev releases. Makes this too much trouble.

Currently on the 1.3.4-dev branch I'm on, some APKs cannot be decompiled. Yet the newest 1.3.4-dev works fine. Have to update it.

I think I'm going to remove the maven REPOs. Its a bitch to keep them updated, and if anyone is even downloading the source to build themselves. I'm sure they can clone an additional 4 repos.

apktool.smali
util
commons
dir

We no longer use maven. So once the smali project is updated, it is updated.

Fixed in v1.5.1
