We have an organization of translation technology articles, and We have translated a lot of documents like [jwasham/coding-interview-university](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university/blob/master/translations/README-cn.md). Could we translate this document into Chinese and share with more Chinese developers? We will open a PR once it's done.  ❤️
