It would be fantastic if mono support was included in termux to at least run cli applications.

Thanks for the suggestion! Will look into trying a cross compile soon, for future reference when looking into this:
- [Mono on ARM information](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/supported-platforms/arm/)
- [Stackoverflow post about cross compiling to Android ARM](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17941856/compile-mono-for-android-arm7)
