First, I'd like to thank you for providing the examples, really great job! However, I'd like more practical explanations since currently they are rather theoretical and hard to understand, don't you think?

For example the Builder pattern, I've read the explanation and honestly do not know when to use in my daily work. Wouldn't it be better just to write that you use it if you have few required and many optional construction parameters?

Hello! I want to offer its my version: https://github.com/NosovDE/PatternBuilder

akullpp: I think you have a point there. Some explanations may indeed be somewhat cryptic.There is room to improve.

Would you like to participate in the project by providing more clear explanations? Just fork the project, edit as you see fit and make a pull request.

Unfortunately, I'm quite busy at the moment but I will try to write something up in my spare time.
