Is it possible that we add web application and database patterns here as well? By web application patterns, I mean
1. Single Thread pattern
2. Synchronization pattern in MVC
3. Double checked locking
4. Service locator
5. Facade
   ..... (any more that we can think of)

and the database patterns I had the data access (DAO) pattern in mind.

Sure, it's possible. Just make a new category for them in `README.md` and give simple well commented code examples. Double checked locking pattern we already have, although not in web application patterns context.
