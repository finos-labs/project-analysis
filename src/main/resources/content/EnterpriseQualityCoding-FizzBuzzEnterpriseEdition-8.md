Seconded needs Spring or similar.

The FizzBuzz class has a lot of object instanciations. It could be less coupled by using a DI framework. All this could go into a clean XML file.

Strongly agree. Please add the necessary prerequisites (such as beans.xml) and at least several EJBs so we can deploy this to, say, JBoss 7. Also a SOAP interface with a jumble of incoherent, inconsistent methods.

This is now addressed with #185.
