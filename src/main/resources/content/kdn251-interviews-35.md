I have been past couple time and seen the directory tree of code implementation.
So it would be good to add a relative link to the direct code.

Not sure what you mean exactly. Could you expand on what you mean?

@EugenHotaj 
I'm talking about the last part of readme.md file.
Where a very well structure directory of code implementation.

So what I'm saying is that why not give direct link the code in repo directory.
I think now you get it of relative link of code in readme file.
