Your map has no way for the enemies to reach the spawnpoint, so it crashes. I should probably fix that.

I see. I corrected the map now and it should work just fine :P

I'll just make enemies not move at all-- Warning the player in the editor would be very resource intensive, as I would need to load the world itself and set up pathfinding context each time.
