You have written a couple of features but not give us how to use them. Sample app does nothing for example.

The sample works fine. Have you actually tried it?


## tasomaniac (07 Oct 2012)

Yeah sample works fine but it does not show how to set phototaplistener etc.

Great library,

I have searched one like this one year before. I couldnt write one tough. :)
I have looked into the code and already found howto do it. But you should
definitely write one.

Thank you. Have a nice day.
