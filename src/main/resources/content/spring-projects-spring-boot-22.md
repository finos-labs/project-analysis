Hi,

When trying to download the binary distribution http://repo.springframework.org/milestone/org/springframework/boot/spring-boot-cli/0.5.0.M1/spring-boot-cli-0.5.0.M1-bin.tar.gz  redirects to http://www.jfrog.com/

Is it a temporary issue or there's some location on jfrog.com the spring-boot-cli could be downloaded from?

Thanks,
Radu

Thanks, I managed to break the links yesterday. The correct URL should be http://repo.springsource.org/milestone/org/springframework/boot/spring-boot-cli/0.5.0.M1/spring-boot-cli-0.5.0.M1-bin.tar.gz.

This has now been fixed in the README
