To truly be an enterprise product I'll need to see a support contract in case it Fizzes when it was supposed to Buzz.

I'm afraid this is not a development issue.

You should contact our marketing department to look into commisioning a custom-tailored support contract fit for your business.

No problem closing this issue, but I will say that given the 5 month interim between opening and closing the ticket is right on par with most support contracts.  You are enterprise ready!

@duanegran Cool, you'll receive a satisfaction survey pretty soon.
