Following my previous [question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/20775165/1863244) on SO it would be nice to have automatic rollback for checked-in connections when their `autoCommit` is set to `false`.

Issue is resolved in the 'dev' branch. You can clone the repository, `git checkout dev`, then build HikariCP using `mvn package`.  This change will be integrated into the next release.

HikariCP 1.2.2 has been released and published to the maven central repository.
