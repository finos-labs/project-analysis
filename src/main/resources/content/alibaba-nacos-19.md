First, I'm proud to see our `Nacos` has been released! 

I find the picture above here: <https://nacos.io/#/docs/what-is-nacos.md?lang=en-us>

**AFAIK, The icon of `Spring Cloud` is not OK. This is the logo of `Spring Cloud中国社区` rather than `Spring Cloud`. 
I don't think use the logo of `Spring Cloud中国社区` is a good idea, since is the forum is never a official group.**

I think WE SHOULD use official icon which Can be found here: <https://spring.io/projects> .

Thanks, you are right, the logo is wrong, I will replace this logo.
