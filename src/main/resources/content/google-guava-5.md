Probably my own fault since it's clearly stated that this isn't ready yet and doesn't
even have a release yet,  but I've sort of already integrated guava in to my own
project and was wondering what the general-ish sort of plan is on getting this one
more in sync publicly with recent collection changes?

"recent collection changes" -- meaning rc3? I've just updated guava to build against 
rc3, thanks for the reminder.

The plan from here is to get collections stamped 1.0-final and, 2 minutes later, copy 
all its source code into this project (guava). Then I can build the first release of 
guava.

Awesome, thanks! Really appreciate and love the work and time-saving these libraries
are giving me btw.  Thanks.
