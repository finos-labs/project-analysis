<b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>
1. Open 'http://guava-libraries.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javadoc/com/
google/common/io/Resources.html'
2. Read the class documentation.
3. Note that "Note that even those these methods use URL parameters," does 
not make any sense, because 'those' should be 'though'.

<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>
svn trunk as of 2009-09-17
