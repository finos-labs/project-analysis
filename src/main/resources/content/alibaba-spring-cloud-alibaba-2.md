The project name is spring-cloud-alibabacloud, but all maven groupId's and the headline https://github.com/spring-cloud-incubator/spring-cloud-alibabacloud#spring-cloud-alibaba are Spring Cloud Alibaba.

I think the project should be renamed to 'spring-cloud-alibaba'. If there is agreement, I can rename. Since github aliases renamed projects, there will be no loss.
