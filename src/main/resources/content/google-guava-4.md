Why is Joiner not in the library?  It is mentioned in the pdf sketch and
seems like a natural function to include.  What happeneed?

<b>What steps will reproduce the problem?</b>
1. Look at rough sketch pdf 
2. Note it mentions Joiner
3. Look at API docs and jars, note Joiner is missing

<b>What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?</b>

0.1

I am sorry for the massive confusion that will continue as long as our code is split
between this project and the Google Collections project. As soon as we can hit 1.0 on
that code (because we promised it), which is our focus right now, we'll combine the
projects.

Until then:
