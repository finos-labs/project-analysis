This is ridiculous - if I want to have another implementation of FizzBuzz I have to change main() because class FizzBuzz is hardcoded in there. The code is therefore not extensible which won't do for a SeriousBusiness. Class FizzBuzz should be implementing an appropriate interface and be created through a factory.

This issue should be resolved along with a solution for #20.
