#Allow importing the standard SMS database at any time

When ran for the first time, TextSecure allows the user to import the existing SMS database into TextSecure.

But later, there only is the option of importing/exporting a TextSecure SMS database, and nothing to re-import the standard SMS database (useful when the user did something wrong and wants to start over)

It's kind of an issue: you can still clear all TextSecure data from Android and start over, but it also resets your keysâ€¦

So, it would be cool to be able to trash all existing TextSecure SMS and re-import the standard SMS database, all in one go and without resetting the keys.
