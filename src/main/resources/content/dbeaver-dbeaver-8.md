DBeaver should support High DPI resolution (Retina, etc).
Mostly this task is for Eclipse platform but DBeaver also should provide icons with bigger resolutions and maybe some additional UI fixes will be also required.

This task will be suspended for a while. I can't test it.

Probably big number of problems will be fixed after migrating to Eclipse 4.6:

Eclipse 4.6 migration is planned in DBeaver 4.x.

Neon M6 has HiDPI support out-of-the-box (https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.6/M6/)

Basically HighDPI support will be added in 4.0.
Any problems and OS-specific issues should be tracked in separate issues.
