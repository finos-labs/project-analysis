Hello all,

I just wanted to say that this is a great project which is on the right track for the future of software development generally.  Dependency driven change propagation is the essential feature of adaptive, A.I. systems and modelling, and therefore of robotics.  I am designing this feature into my project at BitBucket: keith78201 / XComponents, which you are all welcome to take a look at.  I will be seriously studying integrating ReactiveX into XComponents and other projects I work on.  Please contact me if you want to be added as a team member on XComponents.

Thanks!,
Keith Watson
Software Developer at modelSoftTech.

Closing this down here, as this is a bug tracker.
