Sorry sorry... Imgur gave me the wrong link... ðŸ˜¥ 
`https://i.imgur.com/dAFMjEJ.gif` <correct link

That's why i was making commits like crazy because the 'image no longer available' placeholder wasn't there... I thought that the link when you post a new image (the link was shorter) was the correct one but turns out it was a link to the actual image page...
Correct GIF:
