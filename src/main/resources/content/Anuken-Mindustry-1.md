Before I say anything else, let me just tell you this game is great. (I can't really count the amount of hours today I've spent playing it. :P)
But anyways, during those many hours I've encountered this bug where enemies occasionally get stuck in/on the walls, which is nice, as it pretty much gives you infinite time to prepare, but also slightly frustrating when you have to travel all the way to the beginning of the maze map in order to kill the ones that got stuck in order for the next round to start.

You can see them stuck in the image below:

Hmmm. Seeing as they're getting stuck _on_ the blocks, it's probably a problem with my psuedo-AABB physics. I've fixed the issue, but unfortunately I'll be away for the next ten days or so, and won't have time to update the itch game page.

Actually, nevermind-- it doesn't look like I'm going anywhere, after all. I've updated the itch.io page now.
