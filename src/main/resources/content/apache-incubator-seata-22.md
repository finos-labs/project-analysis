（1）能不能搞1个spring cloud的调用使用demo？
（2）可以使用微服务的分布式事务吗？

Welcome get involved in Fescar for working with Spring Cloud. Supporting Spring Cloud is surely in our roadmap. It's will be very nice if you can try a demo or solution. 👍 Or at least, you can share you use cases in detail.

Question (2), I don't quite follow it. Fescar is JUST a solution for distributed transaction in Microservices architecture.
