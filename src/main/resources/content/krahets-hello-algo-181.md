I used google translate to view the book's contents and found it helpful. But the problem is that google translate is limited to the translation of text only not images, so it is tough for me to understand the code.

Unfortunately, English is not supported for now. ðŸ˜¢  I'm considering translating the figures into English, but it may take quite a while.

Alright, it's fine. I'll figure out some alternative to do so, thanks!
