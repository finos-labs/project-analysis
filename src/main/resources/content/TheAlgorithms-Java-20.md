I have tried to push implementation onto new branch but it seems you have prevented people from creating new branches.

What files did you try to add? It should have worked

## Moro-Code (18 Apr 2017)

Well I tried to add a circle linked list implementation with generics. I tried to create a new branch however it denied me from doing so

What you have to do is fork this original repository. Add in the Circle Linked List files. Then perform a pull Request and wait for the owners to approve your request.
