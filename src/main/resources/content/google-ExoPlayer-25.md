Hi,

I've downloaded the project and when I imported it it generated problems.. I tried looking for the file that has generated problems but I didn't find any. The error message pops up when hitting IMPORT after choosing the right path.. Can anybody help me ??

This sounds like a general problem with importing projects into Eclipse (not ExoPlayer specific). Please ask somewhere like StackOverflow instead [NB - I suspect more information will be needed for someone to solve your problem]. Thanks!
