Please add branches 1999.1-dev, 1999.2-dev, etc. (through to our 2012.2 release) - our offshore development excellence team will be using these.

Also: missing document describing the 13-way merge process for getting patches on legacy code into master.

Where is the tagging schedule? Did you update the sharepoint?
