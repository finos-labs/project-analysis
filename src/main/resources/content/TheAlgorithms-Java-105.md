#Multiple definitions of Node

The Node class is widely used across many data structures and algorithms. Right now, there are multiple definitions of this class, in basically every single data structure/algorithm that uses it. This introduces a lot of redundancy into the codebase, and also makes bugs more likely to happen. I suggest removing the duplicate declarations of this class where possible, and simply reusing the Node class as defined in Misc.
