One of the most useful features of Solr is faced searching - is that likely to be added to elasticsearch at any point?

Can you please send questions to the mailing list? This is not a feature request format, its a question that might lead to a discussion which will end up as a feature request. ES has basic support for facet queries, other types of faces are on the road map.

Sure, I'll use the mailing list for this kind of thing in the future. Thanks for the replies.

Sure, no problem. To be honest, I don't know where best to conduct this. I now see that others actually maintain a mini forums in the issues, I am simply used to mailing lists to have discussions, and issue trackers to have discussions about open bugs or features implementations. But, maybe I am wrong, and this is a better place, what do you think?

Closing for now. Will create issues for each new facet support that I plan.
