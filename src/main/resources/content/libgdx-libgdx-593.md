Hello,

(@badlogicgames: you might have noticed me posting on the gl2-android 
project as well)

I am not a robot, but I suppose for the purpose of this visit I might as 
well be. I just wanted to drop by real quick to check if you are at all 
familiar with the jMonkeyEngine project. It seems our projects might have a 
thing or two in common. http://jmonkeyengine.com/blog/blog/2010/02/10/android-support-confirmed- for-jme3/ http://www.jmonkeyengine.com/forum/index.php?topic=13176.0 http://www.jmonkeyengine.com/forum/index.php?topic=13217.0 We are on the lookout for an Android developer to help us bring jME3's 
preliminary Android implementation to a mature, fully functional state. http://docs.google.com/View?id=dhkt6vsf_251c54bg9hp Maybe you could be that developer? or, maybe you know someone who might be. 
Naturally we'd also appreciate having more testers or plain Android-savvy 
people around in our community. Any reason at all for you to contact us, 
feel free! Contact information can be found in the docs link above.

Thanks for your time,

~ Erlend Sogge Heggen

Hi,

i know jmonkey and like it. However, i want to focus my energy on libgdx. Feel free
to use anything you can find libgdx to help your efforts.

Also, please don't file a FUCKING DEFECT if you want to advertise jmonkey! WTF?

Ugh, I'm sorry, I didn't know I was acting out of order. It's just that I noticed your 
project, it looked cool so I wanted to contact you, but I had no idea how. Posting here 
seemed like the best way to get in touch, and it did help me connect with a lot of 
other interested developers.

You have my sincere apologies for the inconvenience I've caused. Good luck with libgdx, 
maybe our paths will cross in the future :)
