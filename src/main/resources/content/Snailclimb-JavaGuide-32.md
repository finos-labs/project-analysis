 It looks like your repo is trending. The [github_trending_videos](https://www.instagram.com/github_trending_videos/) Instgram account automatically shows the demo gifs of trending repos in Github.

Your README doesn't seem to have any demo gifs. Add one and the next time the parser runs it will pick it up and post it on its Instagram feed. If you don't want to just close this issue we won't bother you again.
