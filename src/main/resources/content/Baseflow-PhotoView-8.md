Nice component!  One issue I have noticed is when flinging horizontally (especially if  the image does not fill the screen vertically) you see a brief flash of the screen shifted vertically and overlaid on the image, looks a bit disconcerting.  Doesn't happen on Android 4.1

Hi, what version of PhotoView are you using?
