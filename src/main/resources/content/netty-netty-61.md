We should remove `@version` Javadoc tags because it's not relevant anymore since we moved to Git.

I can do this in a few days if you want, on the last assignment for the year. Once that's marked off, I'll be right to do it :P

That would be amazing. Thanks a lot! :-)

Any time :)


## normanmaurer (24 Nov 2011)

:) Go ahead...


## CruzBishop (01 Dec 2011)

Alright, last task is finished and marked off. I'm starting on this now :)


## CruzBishop (01 Dec 2011)

Done for the 4.0 branch, I'll do it for the 3.2 branch in the morning. I don't trust myself to not delete the wrong parts at the moment


## normanmaurer (01 Dec 2011)

I think we should not do it in 3.2 as its only "cosmetic stuff"...


## CruzBishop (28 Dec 2011)

I just had a look; There does not seem to be any version tags in 3.2. Does that mean this can be closed now?


## normanmaurer (08 Jan 2012)

Yes...
