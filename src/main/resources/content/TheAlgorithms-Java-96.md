Would you be interested in a Java 8 implementation of an Image processing algorithm - Histogram Equalization Algorithm?

## avsingh999 (15 Oct 2017)

would you interested in segment tree find the minimum in a range

## akshay326 (17 Oct 2017)

can try for nested_brackets.py and password_gen.py equivalents, as in pull request #218 

## manimanasamylavarapu (21 Oct 2017)

Hi I am getting this error
remote: Permission to TheAlgorithms/Java.git denied to manimanasamylavarapu.

## varunu28 (21 Oct 2017)

@manimanasamylavarapu I suppose you were trying to edit the main repo

## manimanasamylavarapu (21 Oct 2017)

@varunu28 you are right!! I then forked and proceeded .Thanks :)


## chugh22 (21 Oct 2017)

added Tarjan's Algorithm for finding articulation point in a graph #245 

## akshay326 (25 Oct 2017)

separated main and generatePassword functions #218 

## PAPERPANKS (25 Oct 2017)

@AnupKumarPanwar reopen this issue i have added a new example

## YJDave (25 Oct 2017)

@AnupKumarPanwar Add algorithm for [Bucket Sort](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/pull/267). Let me know if any changes are required :)

## italo-batista (31 Oct 2017)

I have just opened a [pull request](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/pull/293) in which I add the Floyd Warshall graph algorithm to find shortest paths between every pair of vertices. If you please review me.. (:

## italo-batista (31 Oct 2017)

I also opened a [pull request](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/pull/294) to add the sorting algorithm QuickSortMedianOfThree. :grin: 

## zhexuany (31 Oct 2017)

add a algo for coin change https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/pulls

## italo-batista (31 Oct 2017)

[Pull Request](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/pull/300) to add Bellman-Ford graph algorithm to find shortest path from one vertex to all. :smiley: 

## Febaug (12 Nov 2017)

Hey, a friend of mine and I would write the Hopcroft-Karp algorithm with the amount of maximal cardinal matchings as output and - if we're able to implement it - extend it later to give out the exact matchings.

## Phil-Schmidt (13 Nov 2017)

Hi there, user Febaug has tipped me off about this project and I'd like to contribute as well. I've seen that you have a subdirectory for crypto algorithms, but you're still missing an implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard. I'd love to build that for you unless you see a problem with that.

## YooSeonjae (17 Dec 2017)

Add a circular queue or ring wait, a data structure that uses a single fixed-size buffer just like an end-to-end connection
#322 

## YooSeonjae (17 Dec 2017)

One of the greedy algorithms, Scheduling to Minimize Lateness
#309 


## anthonycampbell (21 Apr 2018)

Could I add a skiplist implementation?

## RishiPrakash (02 May 2018)

I have added [pullRequest](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/pull/433)   , please review and merge.
