Is there a command to retrieve the browser's console output? This for various log levels, preferable as an event?

This feature has been raised in the WebdriverIO repository at https://github.com/webdriverio/webdriverio/issues/464 but it seems that this is rather a Selenium thing.

Let me know if this is already implemented or on your todo list. Thanks
