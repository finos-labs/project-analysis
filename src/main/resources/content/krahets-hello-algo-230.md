Now, our sorting chapter is mainly composed of three parts：
- 算法流程
- 算法特性
- 效率优化

I want to add a new category. It's called 小练习? 😁
e.g Bubble sort
## 小练习
- [283. 移动零](https://leetcode.cn/problems/move-zeroes/)
- [剑指 Offer 45. 把数组排成最小的数](https://leetcode.cn/problems/ba-shu-zu-pai-cheng-zui-xiao-de-shu-lcof/)

The purpose of this idea is to make learning get positive feedback and deepen the impression.

Thanks for the good idea. I believe the two LeetCode questions are not closely related to the Bubble Sort. Could we find a better one?

This is just an idea, and the problems I've seen are very poor.
