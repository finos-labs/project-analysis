I can not swith log4j to logback.
After exclude log4j dependency and add logback-classic,it reports such warnings;
log4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (com.alibaba.dubbo.common.logger.LoggerFactory).

Why not follow the slfj standard , but develop another log module?

Recommend the use of slf4j,if someone want to expand some features, such as make a new log wheel,he only has to include 5 class:Logger,ILoggerFactory,StaticLoggerBinder,StaticMarkerBinder and optional StaticMDCBinder class

I've met the same problem. My whole project uses logback for logging, but dubbo's introduing log4j breaks everything down...

We will to consider using slf4j as the standard log frameworkã€‚
