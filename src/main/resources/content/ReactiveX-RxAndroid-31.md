I think it'd be great if we had a formal changelog.

I made this as an issue in case anyone wanted to discuss the format. For reference, this is what [the RxJava changelog looks like](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/blob/1.x/CHANGES.md).

Wait, I'm incredibly stupid and/or blind. [IGNORE ME](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGbPs5y3oz8).

Haha no shame there, I literally only added it like a day ago.

I debated with Ben whether we should just use GitHub releases, but he made
a good point in saying that this means giving up control of that
information entirely to GitHub, so I will both maintain the CHANGES file
and the releases page from here on.
