为了未来更方便的将Nacos推进到CNCF或者Apache社区孵化，我们恳求大家尽量
用英文发proposal，issue或者comments等，尤其是高质量的那些。（当然，仍然是非强制的）

如果您觉得中文交流更舒服，作为一个建议，您可以尝试在中文的后面加上简单的英语摘要。

In order to promote Nacos to the CNCF or Apache community more conveniently
in the future, we beg you to publish the proposal，issue or comments in English，Especially those of high quality (Of course, it is still non-mandatory).

If you feel that Chinese communication is more comfortable, as a suggestion, you can try to add a simple English summary.
