A <b>binary tree</b> is different from a <b>binary search tree</b>. Elements on left may not be always smaller so a clear <b>distinction</b> should be made.

@dynamitechetan  I would like to work on this issue. I saw the implementation in the code and the issue seems to be correct. The binary tree actually implements the binary search tree. So it would have to be renamed and the explanation in the comments need to be improvised to make it more clear. Kindly assign this issue to me
