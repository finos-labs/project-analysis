# Project to Calendar Event Mappings
# Maps projects from README to their associated calendar events using keyword patterns
# Events are matched if they contain any of the specified keywords/phrases (case-insensitive)
# Assume the name of the project is also a pattern.
# So, if you include the project name in the meeting name (good practice), you won't need to map it here.
