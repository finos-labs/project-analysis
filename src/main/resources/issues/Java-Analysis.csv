"," Future project updates will follow standard typography rules to maintain consistency."
JavaGuide,Snailclimb,12," There is a misunderstanding or confusion in the JavaGuide repository about the concept of value transfer and reference transfer in Java."," Misunderstanding of these core concepts could potentially lead to incorrect usage, causing bugs or inefficient code."," After extensive discussions and examples, it was clarified that Java always uses call by value. Even though the method receives a copy of all parameter values, it does not mean Java does not have reference transfer. The method can change the state of an object parameter but cannot let an object parameter refer to a new object."," Future confusion can be prevented by correctly documenting and teaching these core concepts in JavaGuide."
JavaGuide,Snailclimb,13," The user has found several inaccuracies in the explanation of HashMap operation in the Java Guide, including the hashing process, resolving conflicts and the time complexity of various operations."," The risk is misinformation being spread among users who refer to the guide, leading to potential errors in their understanding and application of Java and HashMap functionality."," The repository owner reviewed the inaccuracies pointed out, agreed with the user's suggestions, and updated the guide to accurately explain the functionality of HashMap."," The repository owner can ensure accurate information by periodically reviewing the guide, considering user suggestions, and updating the guide with correct information as necessary."

A new SourceMaps for webpack was implemented to enhance performance."," A shift to react-native could be considered to enable better integration with webpack. Further work needs to be done to make source map devtool pluggable. Suggestions were also made to cache loader results for faster startup."
react-native,facebook,7," Lack of clear guidelines for exposing native APIs in React Native."," Potential for inconsistent or inefficient API usage; difficulty in maintaining and expanding the project."," Discussion on best practices and possibilities; closing the issue as it was more of a discussion and not an actionable issue."," Consideration of allowing users to create their own bindings via plugins, potentially also implementing an automatic option."
react-native,facebook,8," Lack of support for Webpack dev server in the React Native project."," This could potentially disrupt the workflow of developers who rely on transforms such as 6to5, and prevent the integration of Hot Module Replacement."," A suggestion was made to host files on localhost and work with the existing setup, but formal support for webpack-dev-server was not implemented."," Developers are encouraged to adapt to the existing setup, or reopen the issue if further help is needed with the react hot loader."

react-native,facebook,12," Running on device was not initially possible, causing a red error screen as the device couldn't find localhost."," This issue could prevent users from properly testing and using the React Native framework on their devices."," A solution was provided which involved either running the server on the user's computer and changing 'localhost' to their IP or using cURL to download and reference the file. Eventually, the issue was fixed by the team."," To prevent such issues, the team planned on implementing a build step that compiles the JS source into a resource file in the app bundle. Documentation was also suggested to guide users through similar issues."
react-native,facebook,14," XMLHttpRequest does not support response headers in the React-Native project, with `getAllResponseHeaders()` only acting as a stub and no implementation of `getResponseHeader`."," This could potentially inhibit any future development that requires response headers, potentially limiting functionality."," The issue was resolved with a pull request made by the issue reporter."," No specific preventative action mentioned, but regular checking and testing of new features could help identify such issues in the future."
react-native,facebook,16," Poor error message when user forgets to run 'npm install'."," User experience is affected, potentially leading to less adoption of the tool."," The error message was improved by detecting if the node_modules directory exists."," No specific preventative measure mentioned, but continuous enhancement of error messages can help in the future."
