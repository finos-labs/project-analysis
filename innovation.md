_The AI Readiness SIG provides a space to address AI-related challenges that are common to all members._

> The AI Readiness SIG provides a space to address AI-related challenges that are common to all members.

> 
> There are certainly challenges and issues with the current technology (hallucinations, prompt injections), but things are moving at pace, and the technology challenges we see today may not exist tomorrow.
