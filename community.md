_The AI Readiness SIG provides a space to address AI-related challenges that are common to all members._

> The AI Readiness SIG provides a space to address AI-related challenges that are common to all members.

Very few technologies in the past have had such a broad 'reach'.
>

> Since first launching in 2022, FINOS’ DEI SIG has achieved strong momentum encouraging the participation of underrepresented groups and delivering keynote panels at [OSFF](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-finance-forum/); running federated events within the FINOS community and sharing best practice on open source in financial services with diverse communities such as [Anita B’s Grace Hopper Celebration](https://ghc.anitab.org/).
