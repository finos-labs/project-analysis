_The AI Readiness SIG provides a space to address AI-related challenges that are common to all members._



#### From the README:

> The AI Readiness SIG provides a space to address AI-related challenges that are common to all members.
> 
> 
> The recent advances in AI (and more specifically Generative AI) are poised to have a disruptive impact across both our business and home lives. The rapid advances (that are showing no sign of slowing) are leading to a wealth or potential that touches upon the products we (within financial services) offer to clients, our personal productivity as well as the operational aspects of our business. Very few technologies in the past have had such a broad 'reach'.
> 
> There are certainly challenges and issues with the current technology (hallucinations, prompt injections), but things are moving at pace, and the technology challenges we see today may not exist tomorrow.

> Since first launching in 2022, FINOS’ Open Source Talent Acceleration SIG has achieved strong momentum encouraging the participation of underrepresented groups and delivering keynote panels at [OSFF](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-finance-forum/); running federated events within the FINOS community and sharing best practice on open source in financial services with diverse communities such as [Anita B’s Grace Hopper Celebration](https://ghc.anitab.org/).

In 2024, we set further goals to create expanded SIG leadership and contributor opportunities; agree on priorities to develop, advance, and retain diverse talent; ensure FINOS projects are inclusive and events are diverse.
