#### From the README:

> The AI Readiness SIG provides a space to address AI-related challenges that are common to all members.
> 
> 
> The recent advances in AI (and more specifically Generative AI) are poised to have a disruptive impact across both our business and home lives. The rapid advances (that are showing no sign of slowing) are leading to a wealth or potential that touches upon the products we (within financial services) offer to clients, our personal productivity as well as the operational aspects of our business. Very few technologies in the past have had such a broad 'reach'.
> 
> There are certainly challenges and issues with the current technology (hallucinations, prompt injections), but things are moving at pace, and the technology challenges we see today may not exist tomorrow.

> named `"<regular-table>"`, which renders a regular HTML `"<table>"` to a `"sticky"`
> position within a scollable viewport. Only visible cells are rendered and
> queried from a natively `"async"` virtual data model, making `"regular-table"` ideal
> for enormous or remote data sets. Use it to build Data Grids, Spreadsheets,
> Pivot Tables, File Trees, or anytime you need:
> 
> - Just a regular `"<table>"`.
> - Virtually rendered for high-performance.
> - `"async"` data model handles slow, remote, enormous, and/or distributed
> backends.
> - Easy to style, works with any regular CSS for `"<table>"`.
