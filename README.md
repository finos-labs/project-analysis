# Project Analysis

Project Analysis is a tool that scan the FINOS (Fintech Open Source Foundation) GitHub repositories and:
- Generates a readme of readme's, which can be used as a landing page for GitHub Organizations.
- Builds a project health report (in CSV format) that can be used to analyze the health of the projects.

## Features

- **Project Activity Analytics**: Gather and analyze data about project activity, including commit frequency, issue tracking, and pull request statistics.
- **README Summarization**: Automatically generate summaries for project README files to provide a quick overview of each project.
- **Visualization**: Generate visual representations of project activity and README summaries for better insights.

## Scanning the FINOS Project Landscape

**Clone the repository**:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/finos-labs/project-analysis.git
cd project-analysis
```

To scan the FINOS project landscape and gather data, run:

```sh
LANDSCAPE_SCANNING_TOKEN={your-github-personal-access-token} 
mvn spring-boot:run
```

To build the Jupyter notebook:

```sh
python3 -m venv env
./env/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Open `project-report.ipynb` in VS Code and run the notebook; make sure that the `Jupyter` VS Code Extension is installed.

#### Generating a Pull Request

To create a [pull request to Project Analysis](https://github.com/finos-labs/project-analysis/pulls) at the end of the run, set this before running:

```sh
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=pr
```

#### Generating a Personal Access Token

To generate a personal access token, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).

The PAT must have the following scopes enabled:
- Under `repo` the `public_repo` scope must be enabled.
- Under  `adimin:org` the `read:org` scope must be enabled.
- Under `project` the `project:read` scope must be enabled.
