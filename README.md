> Many corporations, especially financial services have strict policies towards opensource contributions. On rare occasions when a developer can contribute to open source, information security and compliance officers often demand complex shadow processes are set up to ensure code reviews, scans and other processes are adhered to before a push to the public repo takes place.

_Plexus Interop open source project hosted by the Fintech Open Source Foundation_



#### From the README:

> The Plexus Interop project aims to define an open standard for desktop application interoperability and provides
> reference implementation of this standard. It formalizes connections between applications within a single user session
> on client desktop through a central broker.
> 
> The main goal is to enable development of extensible workflows connecting independent apps developed by different
> organizations in different technologies (.NET, Web, Java, Python, etc.) by passing relevant context  (structured
> data objects) between those apps.
> 
> Although the industry is moving towards containerized desktop applications, Plexus Interop recognizes that much
> of the application landscape is not yet tied to containers and is architecturally agnostic of container implementation.
> Separating interoperability from the container provides notable advantages: different containers can be leveraged in
> the same workflow, and launched applications residing outside of containers can participate in interop activities.

> Given the wide range of platforms, languages and build systems used by FINOS projects, finding one solution that secures a codebase is not an easy task, especially considering the incredible amount of libraries available in public library repositories, which can be easily used, embedded, integrated and re-published; this proliferation of artifacts have dramatically influenced software development:
> 
> - On average, 95% of the code shipped in a software artifact is composed of upstream libraries (aka dependencies), built, released and managed by external teams, communities and companies that the consumer has no control/influence over.
> - A developer has very little awareness of the codebase quality and software development process in the upstream dependencies of a project, unless going through code scrutiny, which is difficult and time consuming
> - Every programming language and build tool has a different way of consuming dependencies, making security tool adoption harder and rarer; as a consequence, more security vulnerabilities are released into public library repositories, which leads to the exponential growth of vulnerabilities and risk for all consumers using these libraries
